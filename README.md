**Shield Blocking**

This mod fixes the animation issue with shields where a player is shielding but sometimes doesn't show them blocking. This can be very annoying when PvPing as you
don't know if the player is shielding or not. The video below shows a player shielding and in survival.

This mod also factors in the 5-tick delay from shields. This means it will not show the player is blocking until they actually are blocking. The video below shows a player spam using the shield and occasionally holding it up long enough for the shield to actually show.
