<h1>Shield Statuses!</h1>

This mod renders color overlays on player's shields to determine whether that shield is disabled or not.

---
### Information:
**Colors**

This mod will show two/three colors to represent the shield's status:

- Red: Disabled.
- Orange: Disabled, but almost re-enabled.
- Green: Enabled.

**Commands**

- /shieldinterpolate

This command gives you the option to set the shield to either display static red and green colors or to have the red color gradually transition to green. This way, you can estimate when the shield will be reactivated.


**Compatibility & Improvements**

With this version of shield statuses, it ensures to not mess with the actual minecraft textures of the shield itself, but instead renders the colors as an overlay in game to ensure the mod doesn't override custom shield textues from different resource packs.

This version of shield statuses fixes a bug from the original mod, where the shield would incorrectly display as disabled (orange state) even after it had been re-enabled.
